        "# HW6 - Transforming vote tallies\n",
        "\n",
        "This homework give you some insight into the transformations that are underlying all the voting dashboards you've undoubtedly seen all over the news.  Here we are going to use 2020 Presidential election data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset for this week contains voting outcomes for different batches of votes in the battleground states.  The data consist of the following:\n",
        "* The state of the votes\n",
        "* The time the voting results were reported\n",
        "* The number of votes in the batch (new_votes)\n",
        "* The number of those new votes that were for Joe Biden (votes_biden)\n",
        "\n",
        "The key metric of interest is in how each candidate, Biden and Trump, are doing over time in terms of the percentage of votes they're getting with each batch.  This is easier to think of compared to raw numbers for a variety of reasons.  One is that the number of votes varies state-to-state and batch-to-batch, so just thinking about raw numbers doesn't inform very much.  The other is that people are often thinking about the percentage a candidate needs to take the lead or win the state.  If each batch is hitting at or above that percentage, then they have a good chance of winning the state.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this homework is to generate the percentages of votes in each state that are going to Trump and Biden **on an hourly reporting basis**. Each line is a batch of votes that were reported at a given time.  Sometimes there are multiple in an hour.  We want to report a coarser resolution which is why we want to group by hours and days.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Given you have only the variables listed above, you're going to need to do a few things to make this happen:\n",
        "* Import your data and apply a timestamp\n",
        "* Make a column for the number of votes received by Trump\n",
        "* Aggregate your data to get the number of votes for each on a daily and hourly basis\n",
        "* Create columns of the percentages of votes each have received in the aggregated data\n",
        "\n",
        "**NOTE 1** - This is by every measure 'small' data, but it needs to be coded in pyspark.\n",
        "\n",
        "**NOTE 2** - These are all votes that were reported after the initial waves of in-person and early reported mail-in votes.  So if you explore you might see that the total votes in this dataset don't seem to match up with what you would find elsewhere.  That's only because those early votes aren't added in.  These are just batch totals of later reported batches.\n",

        "**Submission Instruction:**\n",

        "* Run all the cells\n",
        "* Download the notebook (.ipynb)\n",
