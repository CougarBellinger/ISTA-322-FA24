If this was part of an ETL you would write up the cleaning and transformations into several functions that then are executed after extracting the data but before loading elsewhere. You would do this on a schedule to where say each month when new taxi data is uploaded you would go and run this and then update the aggregated data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note 2:** This is a pretty lengthy process.  There are lots of steps and times where we think we're done but then have to go back.  For example, we will think we did all our filtering, but then after making a feature realize we needed to do more filtering or filter that new column.  We do something to minimize the number of operations, but sometimes you catch something much later and just deal with it then.  If you were going to turn this into a function you would optimize the sequence of operations a bit more, but I didn't fully do that here so you can see what I mean.  \n"

As you can see, your first pass through, transforming your data has a lot of back-and-forth as you identify issues. Once you figured them out it would be much easier to streamline and turn into a function (see below).  \n",
