## General Purposes
#### Fixing errors
- Lack of precision
- Unnecessary data
- Repetitive data
#### Making data useable / relevant
- Different needs for the data
- Data needs to be transformed into a useful format
- ex:
	- Business Intelligence:
		- display key metrics
		- aggregate daily stats
	- Data Science
		- extract data from strings
		- scale and alter units
## Transforms
#### Errors
- Bad Defaults might need to be fixed
- Deal with empty cells
- Excessive data (ex. too many cols)
- Unnecessary data
#### Making data useable / relevant
 - Extract data from strings
 - Placing data into bins ('Binning')
 - Aggregate data
 - Altering units
 - Calculating useful metrics
#### Check your data
- General external formats
	- ex: right number of digits in zip/phone/social/ID/etc
- Bounded in reality
	- ex: age in 0-115, only positive number for some measures
- Appropriate data structure
	- ex: right numbers of rows and cols, correct data types
